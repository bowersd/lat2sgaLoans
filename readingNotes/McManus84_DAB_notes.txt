p 137:
    Jackson proposed that suffix substitution happened even in the apocope era by replacing latin inflectional suffixes with null suffixes 
        a ref to jackson fleshing out how suffix substitution worked
    McManus wants to propose that doing this did not depend on the existence of an analogous inflectional pattern in Irish to whatever Latin had
    McManus is looking to establish what the fate of final syllables tells us about the borrowing process into Irish

p 138:
    I have no contact with the literature on loanword adaptation, and so I can't tell if there is something more up to date than the literature he goes through
        Perhaps the article from the socio person at Lethbridge (Genee) would be a way in
        Though I don't recall her talking about the final syllable situation

p 141:
    I doubt that direct calques can be phonologically informative for dating, but I guess this should be thought about.

p 142:
    We do have some hybrids in the data

p 144:
    Didn't pay too much attention until pre/post-apocope loans sections, though there could be insights for how to analyze the morphological composition of the loan words here

pre-apocope section:
    affection requires Irish suffixes, not Latin
        not totally open and shut, since he tries to make it seem mysterious how @ could trigger a/o affection (which isn't *too* hard to imagine)
        but the affection story deals with known entities, while the Latin/Vulgar latin story is pretty speculative

post-apocope section:
    there isn't a knock-down argument in favor of suffix substitution in the post-apocope language
    points out that if it happened in pre-apocope, why not post-apocope too?
    stipulates that there was a morphological class assignment process
        gives pretty unsubstantiated reasons to believe that the dominant categories that received loans are the categories that you would expect to receive them
        acknowledges that there are a lot of variables in determining how a morphological class assignment process will work
        points out that a phonological rendering of class assignment does not work for all forms -> this is probably the key 
            the words that lose a stem vowel in addition to Latin case endings is probably relevant to figuring out what the phonology of the post-apocope period was like

    Nothing major hinges on this at the moment, but I'm not totally on board with the idea that apocope has to cease applying once the sound change is complete.
        It could apply to all available words and still be productive for some time
            Applying a null case ending and still losing a stem vowel would seem to be such a case...

    Very weird: eclais < ecclesia is listed as post-apocope, even though the Irish final syllable has been shortened! None of the other post-apocope loans cited have shortening
    Tantalizing: pace of borrowing claimed to have increased in post-apocope language ... but these loans were literary (aka not able to enter spoken language)? or loans stopped getting assimilated (aka more familiar with Latin?)
