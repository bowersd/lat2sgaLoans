             #      /abostol/, lenition would have resulted in /avostol/, which would have given Irish /avstal/. Obviously it depends on the chronology of events, but it seems

             #     is -e. The standard explanation of -e is that it is the result of harmony (specifically lowering) from i to e before a case ending containing a low vowel, e.g.

hand: [2, 5]  Hand is more accurate. This entered after lenition and before apocope. Lenition would have changed d to edh.
             Also, since the non-stressed vowel was shortened, this clearly entered before apocope. I am not sure about why
               Hand and Auto say that Lengthening applied.
             #DAB: yup. need to make sure apocope detection works here too (because a penult long vowel is preserved -> nuke the final vowel before process check)
             #DAB: as for lengthening, is it some weird mis-firing on the initial /a/ lengthening?
             #DAB: --> the reduction of A->@ could only happen if this was a pre-lengthening loan (given this representation). If the final /e/ is removed from Latin, this needs to be a pre-apocope loan
             #DAB: update: now this gets [2, 4] (post-lenition, pre-apocope). Whether it is pre-apocope or pre-lengthening depends on how we think the /e/ was removed (Irish apocope or suffix substitution/British apocope)
             #EJFL: I would say it get removed by suffix substitution. It's the easiest. Either Irish or British apocope run into problems with palatalization since apocope of a
             # front vowel typically leaves behind palatalization, which doesn't happen here.

    #DAB: I actually am a little concerned about the mixing of /f/ and lenited /g/. Didn't we have a story where f>s was clearly pre-lenition, but f>f could be any time?
    #EJFL: Our story on f>s, f>f was not fully written. Here are the main points of discussion:
    #YOU commenting on faba > seib in loan_tabulation_annotated: "I hate to pick at this scab, but mcmanus p 53 sec 64 (and before) gives the ordering differently for f->s words  
    #(and so we need to have our story straight). He says they were borrowed after lenition because lenition created [f] in an allophonic distribution with [sw], and so, even
    #though there is not an [f~sw] alternation (because lenition is done, I presume), via some meta-analogy based on the complementary distribution of [f] and [sw] they swap one
    #allophone for another.  Honestly, our story sounds a lot cleaner to me..."
    #
    #My reply to this was: "To be clear: Our story is that there was no /f/ in Primitive Irish before the changes w>f and hw>f, which are dated after lenition, for us. So Latin
    # f>s must a sound substitution before lenition made by speakers who lacked /f/. Right? 
    # I think that this works for the basic citation forms of f>s words like Latin furnus, Irish sorn "oven". But part of McManus' concern is the fact that none of the f>s words 
    # show any trace of /f/, even in lenited forms. E.g. "my oven" is <mo sorn> /mo horn/ not <mo forn> /mo forn/. His approach makes some sense of this, since he says that f>s is
    # after lenition and that since the general lenition of /s/ is to /h/ not /f/ then we should not expect f>s words to show /f/ in lenited forms. 
    # Our approach makes things a bit complicated in a different way. We could avoid having to deal with the morphological lenition problem associated with the majority of f>s 
    # words by saying that /f/ went to just /s/ not to /sw/ and so there was no way that /f/ would ever have been the lenited variant. Meanwhile, we also need f>s to be /f/ > /sw/
    # for words like flagellum (VL fragillum), otherwise we have no account for the /o/ in the Irish derivative, sroigell. 
    # But if we say that f>s loans really involved /f/ > /sw/ we have no account for why post-f>s loans like figura and februarius behave distinctly with regard to morphological 
    # lenition. This is because we order both post-f>s and f>s before lenition and I made the claim that the /f/ in post-f>s loans should be treated as the result of levelling of 
    # the lenition variants, but in the opposite direction to the loans with /s/ for Latin /f/...There is probably a way out of this muddle but I am muddled."
    #
    #For reference, my argument that figor and febrae have initial f because of levelling in favor of the lenited variant is found in resolved comments in some column in the
    # derivation of these two words in loan_tabulation_annotated. I'm not sure which column, but the comments are:
    #
    # "I don't know about that (i.e. your claim that British lenition was involved in the derivation of figor) because British lenition of g was to zero, although I suppose there
    # was an intermediate step. The sequence could be figu:ra --> swigu:ra: -->  swiGu:ra: -> siGu:ra: in environments where the initial was not lenited and -> hwiGu:ra: in 
    # environments where the initial was lenited. This would give fiGu:ra: where hw was replaced with f. At a certain point f/s alternation in morphological lenition context was
    # levelled out in favor of either s or f so that there was no lenition. Since the connection between figor and Latin figura was probably still understood, I could see the 
    # levelling favoring /f/ in this context."
    #
    # Likewise, for febr(u)arius --> febrae, I said: "As I mentioned with the problem with figu:ra:, I am not sure that we need to invoke British lenition. Basically I think that
    # febra:rijas becomes swebra:rijas and then gets lenited to swevra:rijah. In environments when it can undergo morphological lenition you get hwevra:rijah and with hw>f you get
    # fevra:rijah. So now you have a contrast between unlenited swevra:rijah (> sevra:rijah) and lenited fevra:rijah. Eventually this contrast is levelled out in favor of f or s.
    # Since the connection with februarius was probably still recognized, there was a factor that favored /f/."
    #
    # I can't find any other discussion of this issue at the moment.

             #EJFL: Doesn't your last comment correspond to the theory that British apocope basically totally destroyed final vowels and that the palatalization in Irish 
             # which is characteristic of most of the stems to which British apocope applied is in some sense due to some version of "suffix substitution"? 
             # The problem I have with that kind of thing is why would post-British apocope consonant-final stems fairly consistently targeted for inclusion into a palatalizing
             # morphological class when there is no prompt in the input after British apocope? IF on the other hand British apocope went in stages: (1) lost of back vowels (so
             # here -io: --> -i) and (2) only later to loss of -i, we could say that Irish borrowed the words with final palatalized consonants before the second stage of British
             # Apocope.

        #EJFL: tribu:nus denotes some kind of official in the Roman administration. McManus's explanation was that there is some kind of influence from the native word *treba:
        #which denoted a unit of administration in the Irish political system –– it's usually translated as "household, farm". Anyway, supposedly the native word *treba: was 
        # seen as semantically/morphologically similar in some way to the Latin word tribus (the root of tribu:nus) which was loaned into Irish as triub. Influence from *treba:
        # to triub and triub to *treba: could I guess have created a situation where */trivuN/ was replaced by */trevuN/.
