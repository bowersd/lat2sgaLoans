hand: [4, 7] #EJFL: Hand is more accurate. The final vowel undergoes apocope before syncope. In fact, since Latin long a is
             #       represented by Irish long o this must have past through British. The loss of final e can be ascribed
             #       to British apocope. Either way, the word would not have met the structural description of syncope.
