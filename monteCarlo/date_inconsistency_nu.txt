LENITION COUNT IS RIGHT. FAITHFUL VOICED C COUNTS AS 0. SO WHAT TO DO WITH THIS? I THINK THE TRANSCRIPTION IS WRONG <g> SPELLS [g] HERE 
#EJFL: Actually, g is clearly lenited in modern Irish, where it is spelled aibghitir (pre-1950s reform) or aibítir (post-1950s reform). Since the g is totally effaced, it is clearly lenited. The problem is the b and t (also the modern Irish implies that the orthographic <t> is also phonetic [t]). I don't know what to do with this.

CLEARLY NOT SYNCOPE COMPLIANT, APOCOPE/COMP LEN INVOLVES FINAL V PROCESSING, VV SEQ. I BET THIS IS POST-SYNCOPE WITH A DASH OF CONFUSION  #EJFL The final syllable /de/ in Irish is an Irish suffix. I forgot to remove Irish suffixes from the input. The comparison should be between akrisiOn_E and akrəs_ən. 
OK, EVEN WITH THE SUFFIX REMOVAL THERE IS A DATING INCONSISTENCY BECAUSE THERE IS SHORTENING BUT NOT SYNCOPE (JUST NON-RHYTHMIC SYNCOPATION) 
EJFL: Syncope exhibits some weird behavior when the vowel-to-be-syncoped sits beside r and l (recall Cothraige, Cothairge "Patrick") Is there any reason not to build an override for Vr/rV or Vl/lV into autodate's syncope statement?
DAB: ok, this needs to be discussed verbally, because I'm not sure if you are proposing that there's an epenthetic vowel that then gets deleted (or more generally what the nature of the override is supposed to be), plus I want to get the facts on vowel hiatus (especially involving [i])

PROBLEMS IN A VV SEQ. IS k>x REAL (PERHAPS A LATER ADDED SUFFIX)? I BET THIS IS POST-SYNCOPE 
#EJFL: it is possible that there are two Irish suffixes, -ach /əx/ + -de /ðe/ (or maybe /de/?) attached to the stem Éigipt /Eɣəpt/.
GREAT, SO A LENITED SUFFIX WAS ATTACHED TO A POST-LENITION WORD 
EJFL: You mean post-syncope right? There is an exception to syncope involving the sequence: /Vxt/ (or /Vpt/ which consistently acts the same). This sequence does not undergo syncope (cf. Thurneysen, pg. 67; §106 "The vowel remains only before cht, e.g. cumachte 'might', cumachtach 'mighty'). Is there any reason not to build an override for Vxt/Vpt into autodate's syncope statement? Alternative, I can change the Latin and Irish stem to reflex the fact that -ach /əx/ + -de /ðe/ may have been added post-syncope to base Éigipt.
DAB: possibility 1: -iak is replaced with -ach..., possibility 2: iV vowel hiatus loses a vowel, possibility 3: VptV shifts the syncope site rightwards

I BET THIS IS POST SYNCOPE (syncope clearly didn't happen, and we can't be sure about m lenition). PROBLEM WITH A VV SEQ #EJFL: the final syllable /de/ in Irish is an Irish suffix. I forgot to remove Irish suffixes from the input.
WE ARE GETTING A NON-TRIVIAL AMOUNT OF VV->V SEQUENCES. WHAT IS THE ANALYSIS? I AM LEANING TOWARDS LENGTH BEING PRESERVED, WHICH MAKES A POST-APOCOPE LOAN, (THOUGH APPARENTLY THE INITIAL SYLLABLE IS SHORTENED...). ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO DECIDE THE m>M QUESTION THOUGH. SINCE LENITION WASN'T CONSISTENTLY SPELLED FOR [m] I FAVOR SAYING IT WASN'T LENITED ... BUT OF COURSE THE MODERN LANGUAGE COULD DISPEL THAT NOTION
#EJFL: In the moderl language, names based on this root have /m/, although names can be reborrowed at anytime. I favor changes the stem to just Emili- for Latin and E/emile for Irish (Aemilianus derives within Latin from Aemilius, which would be E/emile in Irish if it enters post syncope). -én /En/ and -de can both be seen as Irish suffixes.  
DAB: we have equivocal evidence for lenition from the old orthography, and equivocal evidence against it from the modern language. As for syncope, we have a clearly unsyncopated vowel (albeit next to an /l/), and a missing vowel that was in hiatus, plus the possibility of Irish suffixes. Cutting the size of the word down only helps autodate, but doesn't absolve us of the analytical question

PROBLEMS IN A VV SEQ. -- I BET PAGAN LITERARY HEROS WEREN'T THE STUFF OF NATIVIZED LOANS... #EJFL: the final syllable /ðe/ in Irish is an Irish suffix. I forgot to remove Irish suffixes from the input. I don't know that this is so difficult, since it is pretty regular to me. If it were a native word it would be the following in Primtive Irish:
*aine:adias > aine:aðiah (lenition) > aineaðiah (shortening) > aineaðeah (affection) > aineaðea (rhinoglottalic loss) > aineaðe (apocope) > aineəðe (reduction - only affects second vowels in hiatus). The stem ajneeðe is basically the same as aineəðe. So there is no problem with this word. In fact it is much more likely to be a loan than the name ajneas (below) itself, since -s- doesn't get deleted so easily. The only problem is something with autodate.
#DAB: autodate detects a failure to syncopate (which looks right to me) and shortening, which is inconsistent. if it were borrowed before lenition, or even just borrowed after affection and got lenited/affected suffixes put on it,  , we still have the shortening/syncope problem. For clarity, if we want to go way out on a limb and say it was a post-apocope loan, we have this UR+derivation (the problem stands for earlier URs too): /ajne:a-ð(-?)e/> ajneaðe (shortening) > ajn_aðe (syncope)
#EJFL: I just came up with this approach o the medial <ee>: the full form of the suffix in Primitive Irish is typically reconstructed as *-odias/odia/odian (masc/fem/neut), so there is actually a vowel that could undergoe syncope under the right conditions. What if this was attached to the stem: *ajne:aodias This would become something like ajnaəðe after syncope, with a VV sequence. Just a thought.
#EJFL: any further thoughts? If *ajne:aodias, how to deal with it?
DAB: for further discussion. FWIW, we probably need to drop this in favor of the root below (don't want to double count)

BUNCH OF WEIRD THINGS, AND I DON'T TRUST SHORTENING. THIS IS CLEARLY POST-SYNCOPE #EJFL: There is a problem with the stem. It should be ewlənste with an s. The -te is a suffix. There is no difference major difference between the Latin stem EolEns and the Irish stem ewləns(te), except the suffix. Maybe a post-syncope loan, but that's not guaranteed by anything.
#DAB: as far as I can tell, with an Irish suffix the word is still trisyllabic and eligible for syncope. Perhaps shortening and syncope applied and there was later epenthesis into the cluster? Or perhaps the word was borrowed (possibly before syncope) and the extra syllable was added after syncope was no longer active ?that actually doesn't quite work, because then shortening should not have applied at all. Or the loss of length was just orthographic and this is a post-syncope loan. Are any of these less likely than the others?
#EJFL: Epenthesis is the most likely. Epenthesis applies to syllabic r/l/n (maybe m) if these are created by syncope. 
#EJFL: Actually, the easiest is to think that there is no shortening here. Change Irish Stem to: ewlEns- + te.

It has undergone suffix substition (or British apocope) and so is much more integreated into the system than words like Achitofel or Aeneas which are not modified from the original Latin/Hebrew shape. So, I'm not sure what to do with it.

SO MESSED UP. IF THIS STAYS, IT NEEDS TO BE HAND DATED (CUTTING OFF THE LAST TWO SYLLS IS NOT WHAT WE HAD IN MIND FOR SHORTENING! AND THE SYNC CALC WON'T WORK HERE), BUT I FAVOR REMOVING IT BECAUSE IT IS SO ABNORMAL. #EJFL : The sequence of events is: ale:lu:ja > ale:li:ja (probably) > alelija (shortening) > aleleja (affection) > alele (apocope) > alle (syncope with palatalization). The output is essentially /aLje/. The only "unusual" thing is the change u: > i:. I don't have any other comparanda, but it could have happened. Besides this, not much problem. Hand-dating is preferable to removal.
#DAB: cool! Any chance of /uj/>ij, instead of u:>i:? Also, is the /l/ really long? I know there's weird stuff

#EJFL: Update: the derivation is entirely regular, but we are missing one ingredient: post-apocope dipthongs become -e: *alelu:ja >
aleluja (shortening) > aleloja (affection) > aleloj (apocope) > alele: (monophthongization) > alle: (syncope + pal) > alle (reduction in unstressed syllable, long-->short).

WAS THIS anania->an_ne? PRE-SYNCOPE, UNCLEAR HARMONY, NEED TO DO SOMETHING SYSTEMATIC FOR FINAL V (SEQS) #EJFL: The sequence of events is: 
anania:s > ananias (suffix-substition) > ananiah (lenition) > ananeah (affect) > ananea (rhinoglottalic loss) > anane > anne (syncope). VERY CLEAR HARMONY: i > e before a.
#DAB: cool! needs a hand date then. Since the affection happens in a suffix, I am disinclined to say this is a pre-affection loan, but good to see that syncope applied. (I bet that transcribing this with nn instead of N would go a long way to getting a better alignment, same for hallelujah) 
#EJFL: I doubt that -e is a real suffix here. -e as a suffix has the following specific uses (a) -e to derive a feminine abstract noun from an adjective, e.g. áith 'sharp' --> áithe 'acuity'; (b) -e to derive a feminine verbal noun from a vebal root, e.g. slaidid 'to slay' --> slaide 'slaying/slaughter'; (c) -e to derive a neuter verbal noun from a verbal root, ar-gair 'to prohibit' --> airgaire 'prohibition'; (d) -e to derive a neuter abstract noun from a noun, e.g. táith 'thief' --> táithe 'concealment'. Annae is a masculine personal name, so -e is clearly not any of these suffixes. Final e is also found as part of other suffixes: -aire (masculine agent noun - not applicable here); -(s)aine (neuter abstract noun, e.g. clam 'leper' --> clamsaine 'leprosy — clearly this is not applicable here); -aige (masculine noun denoting someone related to the nominal base to which it is attached, e.g. scél 'story' --> scélaige 'narrator' — not applicable here); -ine or -ne a rare diminutive suffix, mostly added to common nouns. The last one is slightly possible as a model for Annae, but rather unlikely. As for <nn> vs <N>, I agree.

MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE 0.5) #EJFL: I don't think that lenition of /k/ -> /x/  is phonological here. It is analogical because prefixes on nouns cause lenition. As for the prefix itself, I think that what is going on is the following. The normal Irish negative prefix (corresponding to un- in English) is an-. The word is also spelled anchríst, which must be just "Un-Christ". The spelling with ant- is basically a totally artificial/orthographci way of identifying the Irish prefix an- with the Latin prefix anti- and <t> can be ignored for the perposes of calulating date. In fact, the whole word can be removed - there should be no comparison between antichristus and an(t)chríst - the word is derived witin Irish from Críst (spelled so in Irish).

I GUESS I BUY SHORTENING, BUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH FEWER SYLLS IN LATIN THAN IRISH? #EJFL: The word is Antonius in Latin. Clearly suffix substitution (or British apocope) created the stem Anton- to which the Irish suffix -án was suffixed. The stems to be compared should be Latin: antoni-/anton- and Irish: antən
#DAB: I don't think we can just hack off these Irish suffixes, since they create the environment for shortening and syncope, and if they were applied to the loan at the right time, we would expect these processes to be carried out. So, as above, the syncope-shortening question needs to get sorted out. If the borrowing started out orthographically, that is a good way to lose the length, right?
#EJFL: Maybe you're right about the loss of length being conditioned by ambiguous orthography. By the way, there is a word Antoin in Modern Irish. That would be the expected descendent of Antonius, with final palatalization resulting from "British Apocope" of -ius. From Antoin (short o) Antonán is the expected diminutive. I believe that the loss of palatalization is regular in this context. So we could just analyse Antoin and leave Antonán aside.
#EJFL: Change Irish and Latin stem: antOni. (Latin) compared to antən (Irish). -án is a suffix that can be added at any time. Here added after syncope.

HARMONY TRIGGERED BY u-REDUCING #EJFL: Probably right.
#DAB: We have a later reduction where /u/ reduced as well. This undercuts the u>o>@ argument for harmony right? For this case specifically, do we trust u-reduction more than the lack of syncope, or was there a way to epenthesize @ after syncope?
#EJFL: No that's not how it works. An unharmonized u is NOT reduced by post-syncope vowel reduction to schwa. If there is any reduction it is later than that and outside of our purview which is Old Irish. My suggestion that we count u>ə as the output of harmony is based on the idea that ə can't directly come from u because u is exempt from reduction and must therefore come from /o/, i.e. the affected vowel output by harmony. The stem artəgəl shows harmony because the inflectional suffix is Latin -us (masculine o-stem) which is typically replaced with Primitive Irish -as (masculine), so *artikulas gives the right context for lowering of u to o.
#DAB: Our loanword database has a column for "later reduction", where such words as [konsul] get reduced to [kons@l]. How do we tell whether a word in our dataset with Latin [u] and Irish non-<u>=[@] got there by "later reduction" of /u/ to [@], or by harmony of /u/ to [o] and then by earlier reduction to [@]? Is it just age of text in which the form is attested? 
#DAB: Assuming that the theory where "late reduction" made [@] is wrong,  how do we ensure a coherent timeline for this word? As things stand in pops in to the language for harmony and then goes underground during syncope. Was there later epenthesis? restructuring?
#EJFL: The column "later reduction" is wrong if it shows u > schwa. u doesn't go to schwa via later reduction. If I put it in, that was because I was confused! AS for yor second question, perhaps the Irish stem is actually wrong and the word shouldn't be artəgəl but artəgul or artəkul (I don't know yet if the <c> is pronounced /g/ or /k/). In that case, the sequence is clear: it is a post-syncope loan with no reduction of u>schwa. I would need to check how this word is pronounced in later Irish. 
#EJFL: I think I was totally confused above. REMOVE u>o>@ harmony in autodate. Although I think there are different processes, uou're right that there is no way to distinguish between u->o->@ and u->@ in our data.

#EJFL: /ns/ may be treated as voiceless and u-harmony doesn't necessarily happen across voiceless clusters.
#DAB: Whoops, I was referring to the hypothetical lowering of /u/ to allow eventual reduction.
#EJFL: I think you were right in thinking that there is u>o>@ cannot really work. We should remove it from autodate.

FINAL V, ns OUTCOME, I DOUBT m-LENITION, though [t] is what is triggerig it? (DOES IRISH HAVE A NEW SUFF HERE?)
#EJFL: McManus thinks this is a verbal noun of the verb cosmaid "annoints". The ending -əð is the normal verbal noun suffix. The verb is derived from Latin consumm-are > cosm-aid - So the Latin stem is incorrect.
#DAB: OK, is the derivation konsummare = kosum@ð (phonotactic/suffix adjustment) > kos_m@ð, so that there is no informative lenition or shortening, but there is syncope? If remove the Latin suffixes, the syncope calculation won't work. I'd say this is a case for hand dating.
#EJFL: Agreed.

WHY IS THERE st? AGAIN, s-DOESN'T LENITE. SUCCESSFUL HARMONY IS ia->e, WHICH IS MANAGEABLE BY A NATIVE SUFFIX?
#EJFL: No. There was suffix substition/british apocope (second preferable to me) so that kiklasia became kiklas- and then -te is an Irish suffix.
#DAB: so it is a post-harmony loan (because first syllable doesn't lower) and the [e] in -te is not the result of any relevant harmony.
#EJFL: Yes. Hand-date.

SO MESSED UP, IF IT STAYS (WHICH IS PLAUSIBLE), I DON'T BUY SHORTENING ESPECIALLY WHEN EVERYTHING VANISHES
#EJFL: I think there is no real comparison to be made here. There is a verb damnaid 'damns/punishes' from Latin damnare.
The verbal noun of damnaid is regularly damnad (u-stem, *damna:tus) with gen. damanto (*damna:to:s).
<dammaint> is a nominative i-stem derived from damanto because the genitive of i-stems and u-stems was the same.
<dammain> is probably just an orthographic variant of dammain. – Another possibility is that dammain /damənj/ is from Latin damnum but with
suffix substition to *damni. In this version of the derivation, there is an epenthetic schwa in the Irish form.

IS SHORTENING REAL? ANOTHER WEIRD ST<S
#EJFL: Not weird. -te is a suffix.
#DAB: great! but we still have tension between an unsyncopated vowel and early enough entrance for shortening.
#EJFL: I am starting to thing that there is no shortening in words with the suffix -ens-, which is anyway quite a rare suffix in Irish.

I DON'T THINK m>M IS REAL, IF NOT HEBREW MIGHT STILL BE KEEPABLE THOUGH LIKELY A LITERARY LOAN (NO REASON TO JUST THROW OUT LITERARY LOANS, THEY JUST ARE NOT VERY DIAGNOSABLE)
#EJFL: Certainly not Hebrew. It is Greek. But anyway, there probably was no m-lenition.

WAS SHORTENING REAL (THOUGH IT IS WEIRD TO KEEP LENGTH IN ONE PLACE BUT NOT ANOTHER, IS THERE AN IRISH SUFFIX HERE?)? HARMONY SHOULD NOT BE A FAILURE, JUST [], 
#EJFL: -do:r <-tór> is an Irish suffix here. Why shouldn't harmony be failure? We might have expected dextədOr! Also, since -o:r was always in the final syllable,
even in Latin, is there a reason to expect shortening of the final syllable?FFd
