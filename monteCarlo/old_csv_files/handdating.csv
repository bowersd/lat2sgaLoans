(850 - 200 years after Syncope), in a grammatical context glossing particular examples from Virgil. Very specific and once-off context. Derivatives are only excluded if the root/stem is attested as such in Irish e.g. éigept-ach-dae ~ éigept). They are not excluded if the stems are different, e.g. Aeneas vs aenee-dae.",
